# # MODULARIZING YOUR CODE 2
# #3 PYTHON MODULES 
# #-What a module is(a .py file that can be reused)
# #-Importing built-in modules(math,random,datetime)
# #-Writing your own module(creating my_module.py and importing it)
# #-Aliasing modules(import numpy as np)

# # **What is a Module?**
# # - A module in Python is simply a file with .py extension that contains Python code (functions, variables, or classes) which can be reused in other programs.
# # - Instead of writing the same code again and again, you can write it once in a module and then import it anywhere.
# # - LEts think of a module as a toolbox. Each tool (function, variable, or class) can be taken out and used whenever needed, without rebuilding the tool from scratch.
# # IMPORTING BUILT-IN MODULES
# # - Python already comes with many pre-built modules that you can use directly.
# # - Some common examples are :
# # - math-for mathematical operations
# # - random-for generating random numbers
# # - datetime-for working with dates and time.
# # - etc
# # - To use built in modules,you have to load them into your environment,that is,import them.

# # Different Ways to Import Modules
# # #1. Import the whole module
# # import math

# # # Lets put it to use

# # print(math.sqrt(9))
# # # -Note that you must specify the module name when calling a function within it. 

# # #2 Importing randomimport random

# # # Lets put it to use
# # import math
# # import random
# # print(random.randint(0, 25))


# # # 1. import as an alias

# # import math as m

# # # lets put it to use

# # print(m.sqrt(25))

# # - This shortens the module name, this is common with libraries like numpy, pandas, etc

# # 3. Import specific functions or variables
# from math import sqrt, pi 

# print(sqrt(36))
# print(pi)
# # -here you don't need the prefix 'math' anymore

# # 4. Import everything from the module
# from math import *
# print(sqrt(49))
# print(pi)

# # 4. PYTHON PACKAGES
# #
# - What a package is (a folder with __init__.py)

# - Installing and using third-party packages (pip install requests, import requests)

# - Organizing multiple modules into a package


# **What is a Package?**

# - A package in Python is a way to organize related modules together into a folder.

# - Inside this folder, there must be a special file called `__init__.py` (can be empty). This file tells Python that the folder should be treated as a package.

# - uhmm, let think of a package as a standard mechanic workshop, and each module is a different toolbox inside the workshop. The __init__.py file is like the label on the workshop telling passerbys that this is a mechanic workshop.

# *Do you understand?*



# **Third-Party Packages**

# - Python comes with some built-in modules, but you can also install extra packages created by others.

# These packages are stored in the Python Package Index (PyPI).

# We install them using pip (Pythonâ€™s package manager) or conda a

# # HOW TO INSTALL PYTHON PIP
# # 1. USING PIP
# # - This is the most common method.
# # - It installs packages from PyPI.It is the Python's central package repository.

# - To work with it, you ave to use it in your terminal


# pip install requests                # Install latest version

# pip install requests==2.28         # Install specific version

# pip install --upgrade requests     # Upgrade existing package

# pip uninstall requests             # Remove package

# # 2.USING UV
# #**2. Using `uv`**

# - Thisi is the modern, super-fast package and project manager
# - IT is a RUST-based that unifies package installation, virtual environment and pyton version management into one fast, modern CLI.

# - To use uv
# # Run this command on your terminal depending on your OS

# # Recommended method: standalone installer
#  # macOS/Linux

# curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh

# # or

# # Windows

# powershell -ExecutionPolicy ByPass -c "irm https://astral.sh/uv/install.ps1 | iex"  
# - After installation, verify version.
# uv --version
# - Using uv to install packages
# - But before it works you must have a workin `virtual environment` 
# uv add requests              # Install package and update project files

# uv pip install flask         # Works like pip but much faster

# uv remove requests           # Uninstall

# uv venv                      # Create a virtual environment automatically

# uv run script.py             # Run scripts in the managed environment

# CREATING A VIRTUAL ENVIRONMENT
# - What is a Virtual Environment?
# - A virtual environment (venv) is an isolated workspace where you can install and manage Python packages without affecting the global/system Python installation.

# - Each project can have its own dependencies, even if they conflict with other projects.

# - Why should you form the habit of always creating a Venv before starting a project?

#  - It keeps project dependencies separate.
#  - It prevents version conflicts.
#  - It makes collaboration easier (everyone uses the same environment).
#  - It is required in many production setups.


#  **How to create a Virtual Environment**

# ```
# # Create a virtual environment
# python -m venv virtual_environment_name


# # This will create a folder inside your working folder with the name "virtual_environment_name"
# ```

# - To use it, you have to activate it.

# ```
# # 1. Click on the folder

# # 2. Look for Script and open it.

# # 3. Look for 'activate'

# #4.  Right click on it and look for copy relative path

# #5. Click on it.

# #6.  Finally to your terminal and select Command prompt then paste the path you copied.
# ```


# - Altenatively, you can use this script.

# ```
# virtual_environment_name\Scripts\activate  # For windows

#  source virtual_environment_name/bin/activate # linux or macOS
# ```

# **Deactivating a virtual Environment**

# ```
# deactivate
# ```

# **Saving and Sharing Requirements**


# ```

# # To freeze the installed packages into a file
# pip freeze > requirements.txt


# # To install them later

# pip install -r requirements.txt

# CREATING YOUR PACKAGE
# my_project/
# â”‚
# â”œâ”€â”€ my_package/              # Package folder

# â””â”€â”€ main.py                  # Script that uses the package

# **1.__init__.py **

# - This is a special file tells python that my_package is a package. It can be empty or used to initialize the package.

# __init__.py
print("my_package is being imported")

# # Optional: import functions directly for easier access
# from .math_utils import add, subtract
# from .string_utils import capitalize_text

# 2.maths_utils.py
# - Module for math operations

# math_utils.py 
def add(a, b):
    return a + b 
def subtract(a, b):
    return a - b


# 3.String_utils.py 
# Moudle for string operations
# strings_utils.py 
def capitalize_text(text):
    return text.capitalize()

def reverse_text(text):
    return text[::-1]

# 4. main.py 
# Using the package. 
# Main.py 
# Import the whole package
import my_package
print(my_package.add(5, 3))
print(my_package.subtract(10, 4))
print(my_package.capitalize_text("python"))  # Python

# OR import specific modules
from my_package import string_utils

print(string_utils.reverse_text("hello"))  # olleh


# 5**What is Code Reusability?**

# - Code reusability means writing code once and using it multiple times instead of rewriting it.

# - It helps make programs cleaner, faster to develop, and easier to maintain.

# - In Python, code reusability is achieved using;

#     - Functions (reusing blocks of code)

#     - Modules (saving functions in .py files to import later)

#     - Packages (organizing modules in folders)

#     - Classes & Objects (OOP makes reusable blueprints)

#     - Libraries (built-in or third-party). CODE REUSABILITY


# ðŸ”¹ Why Reuse Code?

#     - Saves time â€“ no need to rewrite the same logic.

#     - Avoids duplication â€“ reduces errors from copy and paste.

#     - Improves readability â€“ your code is modular and organized.

#     - Easy to maintain â€“ update once, reuse everywhere.
