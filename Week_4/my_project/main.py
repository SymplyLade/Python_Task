# 5.CODE REUSABILITY 
# **What is Code Reusability?**

# - Code reusability means writing code once and using it multiple times instead of rewriting it.

# - It helps make programs cleaner, faster to develop, and easier to maintain.

# - In Python, code reusability is achieved using;

#     - Functions (reusing blocks of code)

#     - Modules (saving functions in .py files to import later)

#     - Packages (organizing modules in folders)

#     - Classes & Objects (OOP makes reusable blueprints)

#     - Libraries (built-in or third-party)


    

# ðŸ”¹ Why Reuse Code?

#     - Saves time â€“ no need to rewrite the same logic.

#     - Avoids duplication â€“ reduces errors from copy and paste.

#     - Improves readability â€“ your code is modular and organized.

#     - Easy to maintain â€“ update once, reuse everywhere.

# 6. ORGANIZING A PYTHON PROJECT
# - A modular project is a way of organizing your code into separate files and folders, each responsible for a specific task.

# - This makes the project easier to read, test, and maintain.
# **Why Use Modular Structure?**

# - Separates concerns â€“ Each file has one responsibility.

# - Easier to debug â€“ You can fix issues in one place without breaking others.

# - Reusability â€“ Functions/modules can be reused in other projects.

# - Collaboration-friendly â€“ Multiple developers can work on different parts.
# ```**Folder & File Structure**

# - Letâ€™s say we want to build a Student Records Project.
# - We will first structure our folder and files like this.
# student_project/
# â”‚
# â”œâ”€â”€ data.py        # Handles storing and retrieving student data
# â”œâ”€â”€ utils.py       # Contains helper functions (e.g., calculations, formatting)
# â”œâ”€â”€ main.py        # Entry point to run the project
